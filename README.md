# RestaurantWebApp
This is my first web application made with ReactJs and Firebase!
<hr/>
<h2> Structure </h2>
<ul>
  <li> I used create-react-app for the project's structure</li>
  <li> Components are <b>functions</b> </li>
  <li> Containers are <b>Classes</b> </li>
  <li> Fully <b>Responsive</b> </li>
  <li> I used <b>Firebase Realtime DataBase</b> </li>
  <li> That's a <b>Dynamic Website</b> </li>
  <li> Routing made with <b>React Router</b> </li>
 </ul>

To make changes on the menu you simply need to make changes on the database.
